# AngularJS + ES6 + Webpack weekly project

> Experimenting with ES6 (classes, modules, destructing, rest params, arrows function and more) and Angular v1.5.x

> Tested in Chrome v48.x

A dead simple project with todos list. Basic idea was to implement CRUD with todo items, and store/retrieve them from LocalStorage with futher updating to Angular2.


### For dependency and build
```
$ npm i

TODO:
