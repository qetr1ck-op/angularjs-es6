# AngularJS + ES6 weekly project

> Experimenting with ES6 (classes, modules, destructing, rest params, arrows function and more) and Angular v1.5.x

> Tested in Chrome v48.x

A dead simple project with todos list. Basic idea was to implement CRUD with todo items, and store/retrieve them in LocalStorage.

## For dependency and build
```
$ npm i
```
## For build and watch
```
$ npm run build:js
```
## For webserver and change-detection reload
```
npm run server
```

TODO:
* upd directives to component approach
* upd controller container approach to component tree
* improve build-transpiling system
* upd to Angular2
